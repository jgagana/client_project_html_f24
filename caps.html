            <p>CAPS has a limited number of <a href="privatespaces.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">private spaces</a> available for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces.</p>
            <p>Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews and/or projects.

            <p>CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the confidentiality of our clients.
